Exploring the role of named entities in book similarity

The finished program will take a book as input.
The book will be processed to find the names of people, places and organisations mentioned in the book.
Indirect mentions of people will also be considered.
The importance of entities will be judged based on frequency of direct and indirect mentions, dispresion of mentions throughout the book etc.
Based on the importance of these entitites, other books will be recommended feature these entities prominently.
Currently a work in progress.
